                <h1>About me</h1>
                <h2>Hi! I'm Sam Alawadhi and Iâ€™m a student at Point Park University. As I continue to study for my degree in computer science and accounting, I would like to start exploring career opportunities like shadowing and internships that fit within my interests and goals. 
                    As I enter the professional world, I want to shift my focus towards how accounting and IT work together in the context of business. I value inclusion, achievement, and a learning environment at work. After I graduate, I want to expand my leadership capabilities and apply them to being a manager, as I am goal and team-oriented.
                    Besides holding leadership roles, I'm also fluent in Arabic and English, and have proficiency in French, so I'd love to take my work internationally.</h2>
